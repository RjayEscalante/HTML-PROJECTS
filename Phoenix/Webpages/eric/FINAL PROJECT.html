			<h1>Get to know me...</h1>
			<hr size="3" width="100%" color="#510606">
			<p>I'm a 1st year BS Computer Science student at Gordon College. I'm 19 years old and my complex or hard skills include my mathematical skills, digital skills using learning platforms such as MS Office and Google apps, while my soft skills are adaptability, stress management and problem-solving. I am a people-person and a team player. I really like to talk and listen to different people and can communicate effectively. 
			One of my hobbies is cooking, I like to try different recipes I see on the internet. While I enjoy playing mobile and video games with my friends for quality time, I also enjoy dancing and being physically active for my health.
			<br><br>After I graduate, I want to start a business-related hobbies or get an entry-level job to gain experience and skills. It might sound general right now, but I have to admit that I am yet to discover my potential by studying in Gordon College. One thing is for sure, as much as I want to seize out opportunities, I want to learn and improve my skills about Computer Science and conmtribute to the community with all I can do.</p>
